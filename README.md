# Image Classification using EfficientNet

 Image classification project using EfficientNet encompasses a systematic series of steps aimed at achieving robust and accurate results. The project begins with a clear definition of the classification problem and its scope, laying the foundation for subsequent tasks. The data collection phase involves assembling a diverse and representative dataset, followed by meticulous preprocessing to ensure data consistency and quality. EfficientNet, chosen as the core model architecture, is implemented using a deep learning framework, with a focus on transfer learning strategies from pre-trained ImageNet weights.
Comprehensive documentation is maintained, detailing the dataset, model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics, facilitating knowledge transfer to team members and stakeholders involved in the project. This methodical approach ensures a thorough and effective execution of the image classification project.
